- download and install git to your computer
  https://git-scm.com/downloads

- register an account on Github

- create a repository or ask for the address for the project repository

- create a folder on your computer and a file in it (whatever file)
  eg: a folder: C:\Users\Xing\Desktop\testgithub
      and a file: "blabla.txt"

	- use "cd" to navigate to your working folder

	> git add *
	> git commit -m "blablaname"
	> git push -u origin Xing_feature
